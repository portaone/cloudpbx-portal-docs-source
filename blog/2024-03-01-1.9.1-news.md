### Import Extensions Effortlessly
Now, CloudPBX administrators can easily import extensions from a CSV file using our streamlined process. This will vastly simplify the process of setting up a cloud PBX environment for new business customers – especially when they are switching to your CSP from another provider. In this video, we explain all the benefits of this useful new feature and answer a few FAQs.

### Flexible Portal Configuration for SIP Trunk Management
If you are a Voice Service Provider, delivering those services to business customers over a SIP trunk is a key revenue stream – but how can you prevent churn and losses due to fraud and inefficiencies? Configure your portal to create active or inactive SIP trunks with ease: an "Active" SIP trunk is ready for immediate use, enabling seamless call delivery to and from a customer's PBX. Conversely, an "Inactive" SIP trunk requires manual activation by the service provider before it can be utilized. This may be required if you need to manually activate SIP trunks configured by your customers. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0IS5QXivnA) to learn how you can provide your customers with an easy way to manage their PBX systems, MS Teams, and call centers, while allowing you to offer competitive prices, more flexibility, and better customer service.

Introducing a powerful switchboard feature that empowers users to manage current calls efficiently, including options to hold, disconnect, transfer, or add more participants. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM3tvqwoDa0), we will show you how this powerful feature can dramatically improve the efficiency of cloud call center operations while empowering managers, receptionists, and agents with more ways to optimize their customer experience and their time – even when understaffed.
